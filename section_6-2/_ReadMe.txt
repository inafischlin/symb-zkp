The examples provided in this directory have been either used
for the runtime analysis presented in section 6.3 of the
accompanying thesis or they illustrate the possible elimination
of the witness inside the zero-knowledge proof function
which was introduced in section 6.2.

The alternative lemma formulations of all other examples can be
found incorporated in the restriction-only model theories found
in directory "section_6-1".
